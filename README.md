This is a password generator. When the you press "Generate" you will be presented with a series of prompts to answer about your desired password. If you make an impossible selection or input, you will be presented with an error message to try again or cancel. When you finish the prompts, your password will be displayed on the screen. 

If you press the "Generate" button again, then you can repeat the process to create another password.
